# Command Template: /polaris.specify (Documentation Mission)

**Phase**: Discover
**Purpose**: Understand documentation needs, identify iteration mode, select Divio types, detect languages, recommend generators.

## User Input

**Telemetry**: Run: `polaris telemetry record specify --feature <slug> --phase start --agent {{AGENT_NAME}}`


```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Discovery Gate (mandatory)

Before running any scripts or writing to disk, conduct a structured discovery interview tailored to documentation missions.

**Scope proportionality**: For documentation missions, discovery depth depends on project maturity:
- **New project** (initial mode): 3-4 questions about audience, goals, Divio types
- **Existing docs** (gap-filling mode): 2-3 questions about gaps, priorities, maintenance
- **Feature-specific** (documenting new feature): 1-2 questions about feature scope, integration

### Discovery Questions

**Question 1: Iteration Mode** (CRITICAL)

Ask user which documentation scenario applies:

**(A) Initial Documentation** - First-time documentation for a project (no existing docs)
**(B) Gap-Filling** - Improving/extending existing documentation
**(C) Feature-Specific** - Documenting a specific new feature/module

**Why it matters**: Determines whether to run gap analysis, how to structure workflow.

**Store answer in**: `meta.json → documentation_state.iteration_mode`

---

**Question 2A: For Initial Mode - What to Document**

Ask user:
- What is the primary audience? (developers, end users, contributors, operators)
- What are the documentation goals? (onboarding, API reference, troubleshooting, understanding architecture)
- Which Divio types are most important? (tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation)

**Why it matters**: Determines which templates to generate, what content to prioritize.

---

**Question 2B: For Gap-Filling Mode - What's Missing**

Inform user you will audit existing documentation, then ask:
- What problems are users reporting? (can't get started, can't solve specific problems, APIs undocumented, don't understand concepts)
- Which areas need documentation most urgently? (specific features, concepts, tasks)
- What Divio types are you willing to add? (tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation)

**Why it matters**: Focuses gap analysis on user-reported issues, prioritizes work.

---

**Question 2C: For Feature-Specific Mode - Feature Details**

Ask user:
- Which feature/module are you documenting?
- Who will use this feature? (what audience)
- What aspects need documentation? (getting started, common tasks, API details, architecture/design)

**Why it matters**: Scopes documentation to just the feature, determines which Divio types apply.

---

**Question 3: Language Detection & Generators**

Auto-detect project languages:
- Scan for `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx` files → Recommend JSDoc/TypeDoc
- Scan for `.py` files → Recommend Sphinx
- Scan for `Cargo.toml`, `.rs` files → Recommend rustdoc

Present to user:
"Detected languages: [list]. Recommend these generators: [list]. Proceed with these?"

Allow user to:
- Confirm all
- Select subset
- Skip generators (manual documentation only)

**Why it matters**: Determines which generators to configure in planning phase.

**Store answer in**: `meta.json → documentation_state.generators_configured`

---

**Question 4: Target Audience (if not already clear)**

If not clear from earlier answers, ask:
"Who is the primary audience for this documentation?"
- Developers integrating your library/API
- End users using your application
- Contributors to your project
- Operators deploying/maintaining your system
- Mix of above (specify)

**Why it matters**: Affects documentation tone, depth, assumed knowledge.

**Store answer in**: `spec.md → ## Documentation Scope → Target Audience`

---

**Question 5: Publish Scope (optional)**

Ask user:
- Is documentation release/publish in scope for this effort?
- If yes, should we produce `release.md` with hosting and handoff details?

**Why it matters**: Avoids unnecessary release work when publishing is handled elsewhere.

---

### Intent Summary

After discovery questions answered, synthesize into Intent Summary:

```markdown
## Documentation Mission Intent

**Iteration Mode**: [initial | gap-filling | feature-specific]
**Primary Goal**: [Describe what user wants to accomplish]
**Target Audience**: [Who will read these docs]
**Selected Divio Types**: [tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation]
**Detected Languages**: [Python, JavaScript, Rust, etc.]
**Recommended Generators**: [JSDoc, Sphinx, rustdoc]

**Scope**: [Summary of what will be documented]
```

Confirm with user before proceeding.

---

## Outline

1. **Check discovery status**: If questions unanswered, ask one at a time (Discovery Gate above)

2. **Generate feature directory**: Run `polaris agent feature create-feature "doc-{project-name}" --json --mission documentation`
   - Feature naming convention: `doc-{project-name}` or `docs-{feature-name}` for feature-specific

3. **Create meta.json**: Include `mission: "documentation"` and `documentation_state` field:
   ```json
   {
     "feature_number": "###",
     "slug": "doc-project-name",
     "friendly_name": "Documentation: Project Name",
     "mission": "documentation",
     "source_description": "...",
     "created_at": "...",
     "documentation_state": {
       "iteration_mode": "initial",
       "divio_types_selected": ["tutorial", "reference"],
       "generators_configured": [
         {"name": "sphinx", "language": "python"}
       ],
       "target_audience": "developers",
       "last_audit_date": null,
       "coverage_percentage": 0.0
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Run gap analysis** (gap-filling mode only):
   - Scan existing `docs/` directory
   - Classify docs into Divio types
   - Build coverage matrix
   - Generate `gap-analysis.md` with findings

5. **Generate specification**:
   - Use `templates/spec-template.md` from documentation mission
   - Fill in Documentation Scope section with discovery answers
   - Include gap analysis results if gap-filling mode
   - Define requirements based on selected Divio types and generators
   - Define success criteria (accessibility, completeness, audience satisfaction)

6. **Validate specification**: Run quality checks (see spec-template.md checklist)

7. **Auto-Review & Clarification**: After writing and validating the spec, automatically perform a final review pass:
   1. Re-read the completed spec end-to-end as a critical reviewer
   2. Identify any gaps, ambiguities, or missing acceptance criteria
   3. If issues are found, list them as numbered questions and ask the user to address them
   4. Update the spec with the user's clarifications
   5. Confirm the spec is ready for planning (Phase 2 below)

   This replaces the need for a separate `/polaris.clarify` step. The spec should be fully clarified before leaving `/polaris.specify`.

## Phase 2: Documentation Planning

After the spec is validated and clarified, proceed directly to planning. This eliminates the need for a separate `/polaris.plan` step.

### Planning Interrogation

For documentation missions, planning interrogation is lighter:
- **Simple projects** (single language, initial docs): 1-2 questions about structure preferences
- **Complex projects** (multiple languages, existing docs): 2-3 questions about integration approach

**Always suggest the best option**: Rather than asking open-ended questions, propose the recommended approach.

**Key Planning Questions**:

**Q1: Documentation Framework**
"I recommend [framework] based on your project. Sound good?"
- Sphinx (Python ecosystem standard)
- MkDocs (Markdown-focused, simple)
- Docusaurus (React-based, modern)
- None (plain Markdown)

**Q2: Generator Integration Approach** (if multiple languages detected)
"How should API reference for different languages be organized?"
- Unified (all APIs in one reference section)
- Separated (language-specific reference sections)

Ask one planning question at a time. End with `WAITING_FOR_PLANNING_INPUT` if questions remain.

### Plan Generation

Once planning interrogation is confirmed:

1. **Setup**: Run `polaris agent feature setup-plan --feature <feature-slug> --json` from the repository root.

2. **Load context**: Read spec.md, meta.json (especially `documentation_state`).

3. **Phase 0: Research** (if gap-filling mode):
   - Run gap analysis: scan existing `docs/` directory
   - Classify docs into Divio types
   - Build coverage matrix
   - Generate `gap-analysis.md`
   - Research generator configuration options for detected languages

4. **Phase 1: Design**:
   - Design documentation structure following Divio organization
   - Configure generators (Sphinx, JSDoc, rustdoc)
   - Generate `data-model.md` with documentation entities
   - Generate work breakdown outline
   - Generate `quickstart.md` with build/add/validate instructions

5. **Commit planning artifacts** to the target branch.

### Report Completion

Report:
- Spec file path
- Plan file path
- Artifacts generated (research.md, data-model.md, gap-analysis.md, quickstart.md)
- Readiness for `/polaris.tasks`

**STOP**: This command ends after generating spec AND plan artifacts. The user should run `/polaris.tasks` next.

## Key Guidelines

**For Agents**:
- Ask discovery questions one at a time (don't overwhelm user)
- Auto-detect languages to recommend generators
- For gap-filling, show audit results to user before asking what to fill
- Store iteration state in meta.json (enables future iterations)
- Emphasize Divio types in specification (tutorial/how-to/reference/explanation)
- Link to Write the Docs and Divio resources in spec

**For Users**:
- Discovery helps ensure documentation meets real needs
- Gap analysis (if iterating) shows what's missing
- Generator recommendations save manual API documentation work
- Iteration mode affects workflow (initial vs gap-filling vs feature-specific)


**Telemetry**: Run: `polaris telemetry record specify --feature <slug> --phase complete --agent {{AGENT_NAME}}`
